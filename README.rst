Introduction
------------

View the World Health Organization's Covid-19 situation report data.

.. Note:: This project is still in early planning phases.

`dash-covid19 <https://github.com/rbpatt2019/dash-covid19/>`_ is a `Dash <https://dash.plotly.com/>`_ app for viewing the information related to the spread of Covid-19 using the data provided in the World Health Organization's (`WHO <https://www.who.int/>`_) daily `situation reports <https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/>`_.

The data is curated and provided by `Namara <https://app.namara.io/>`_, and manually downloaded by myself. As this project develops, automatic queries using Namara's API will likely be incorporated.

Docs and Code
-------------

The documentation is forthcoming, once I've integrated Sphinx and Dash apropriately.

The code lives at https://github.com/rbpatt2019/dash-covid19/ .
